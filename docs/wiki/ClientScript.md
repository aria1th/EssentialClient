# ClientScript

## What is it?

ClientScript is a feature of [EssentialClient](https://github.com/senseiwells/EssentialClient) what allows you to write
scripts for the client directly into Minecraft. It extends [Arucas](https://github.com/senseiwells/Arucas) which is an
interpreted language, with very similar syntax to Java using Java as it's host
language, [Arucas](https://github.com/senseiwells/Arucas), has the core functionality of a programming language and
ClientScript adds all the Minecraft functions.

The main purpose of ClientScript is to create modifications and player automation without having to make a mod.

## How do you use it?

You must have [EssentialClient](https://github.com/senseiwells/EssentialClient) installed, then after you have booted
the game, you can navigate to the Essential Client Menu. Once you have opened this menu there will be an option to open
Client Script Options, this will open up a config screen where you can manage your ClientScripts. You can create a new
script (top left) and give it a name, then click 'Open Script' to open it, this will open a prompt asking you what
program to open the file with, open it with any text editor (IntelliJ has a Highlighter for the language, you can find
that [here](https://github.com/Kariaro/ArucasHighlighter/releases)). ClientScripts are stored
in `.minecraft/config/EssentialClient/Scripts`.

Each script can have a dedicated keybind to toggle it on or off.

If you don't want to make your own scripts that's fine, there are people who have already written scripts and who are
sharing them. You can download these by navigating to the Client Script screen and in the top right hitting the download
button, a list of available scripts will then be displayed for download.
