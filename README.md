EssentialClient is a client side only mod originally forked from [Carpet Client for 1.15.2](https://github.com/gnembon/carpet-client) that implements new client side features.

To access the Essential Client menu you must join a world, then it will be accessible to you when you press
`ESC`, you can enable menu access from the title screen by enabling [essentialClientButton](#essentialclientbutton).

Feel free to contribute by adding as many features as you want!
