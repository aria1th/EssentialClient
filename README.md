EssentialClient is a client side only mod originally forked from [Carpet Client for 1.15.2](https://github.com/gnembon/carpet-client) that implements new client side features.

This mod is currently supporting 1.16.5, 1.17.1, and 1.18

1.16.5 requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) v0.35.1+ and [Carpet Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/carpet) v1.4.26+.

1.17.1 requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) v0.40.1+ and [Carpet Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/carpet) v1.4.44+.

To access the Essential Client menu you must join a world, then it will be accessible to you when you press

Feel free to contribute by adding as many features as you want!
